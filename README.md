**ABSTRACT**<br>
Vault is usually found in a bank or other financial institution, which is a safe and secure place for storing items of value.<br> Bank vaults must meet a series of safety regulations, created by the Federal Reserve Board. Vaults are usually used to store cash, as well as customers' safe deposit boxes.<br>	
We the researchers would like to make a vault that can be use in storing valuable items that you want to keep at your houses.<br>Our project is a homemade Multi security arduino vault, it has a digit code and a finger print scanner, the solenoid lock is used to secure the door, and it has a buzzer for the intruder alerts.<br>
This project will help an individual who cannot afford an expensive vault. The body of this project is made up of strong type of wood, and which can stand in normal human force.
